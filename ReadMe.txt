We are Janaki Obillaneni,Susroonya Koduru, and Varshitha Challa, worked on this project as a part of our course work,Computer vision in Computer Science.

We have developed three models, RESNET50, EfficientNet and Vision Transformers to detect traffic from the images.

resnet50-covid.ipynb - contains the code for implementing the model ResNet50 and all the information regarding it.
efficientnet-covidx (1).ipynbProjectVTShiftPatch - contains the code for implemeting the model EfficientNet and all information regarding it.
ProjectVTVanilla.ipynb - contains the code for Vision transformers using fixed patch tokenization
ProjectVTShiftPatch.ipynb - contains the code for Vision transformers using shift patch tokenization
